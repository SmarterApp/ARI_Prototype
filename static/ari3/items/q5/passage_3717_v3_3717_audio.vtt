In the novel around the world in
80 days the character

00:03.965 --> 00:07.940
Phileas Fogg successfully completed
a trip around the globe in 80 days.

00:07.995 --> 00:14.648
In 1889 an American Journalist named Nellie Bly
decided to try to break that imaginary record.

00:14.865 --> 00:16.649
In the section that follows,

00:16.701 --> 00:20.777
Bly explains her plan to her bosses
at the newspaper where she works.

00:20.970 --> 00:23.613
Listen to the section
from Nellie Bly's book,

00:23.713 --> 00:26.356
to learn about some of
the challenges she faced,

00:26.576 --> 00:29.297
then, answer the
questions that follow.

00:29.648 --> 00:33.268
I wanna go around the world
in 80 days or less.

00:33.383 --> 00:36.951
I think I can beat Phileas
Foggs record, may I try it?

00:37.261 --> 00:42.678
To my dismay, he told me that in the office
they had thought of this same idea before,

00:42.780 --> 00:45.345
and the intention
was to send a man.

00:45.447 --> 00:49.679
However, he offered me the consolation
that he would favor my going,

00:49.820 --> 00:52.802
and then we went to talk with
the business manager about it.

00:53.318 --> 00:57.446
It is impossible for you to do
it, was the terrible verdict.

00:57.652 --> 01:01.688
In the first place you are a woman,
and would need a protector,

01:01.791 --> 01:05.372
and even if it were possible
for you to travel alone

01:05.446 --> 01:10.459
you would need to carry so much baggage that it
would detain you in making rapid changes.

01:10.613 --> 01:15.678
besides you speak nothing but English
so there is no use talking about it.

01:15.703 --> 01:18.345
No one but a man could do this.

01:18.395 --> 01:21.038
Very well I said angrily

01:21.101 --> 01:26.453
start the man and I'll start the same day
for some other newspaper and beat him.

01:26.698 --> 01:29.497
I believe you would he said slowly.

01:29.626 --> 01:33.155
I would not say that had any
influence on their decision

01:33.205 --> 01:35.692
but I do not that before we parted

01:35.724 --> 01:40.281
I was made happy by the promise that if
anyone was commissioned to make the trip

01:40.346 --> 01:42.174
I should be that one
